# SEO Keywords Through an Elderly Customer's Eyes
## A Stone Engraving Business Research from a 65+ Year Old's Perspective

---

## Who Am I?
I'm a 65-70 year old retired person living in Goa. I've lived through traditions, cultural practices, and I understand the value of lasting things. I don't search like young people do—I think about what I actually need, what my family needs, and what lasts. Here's how I would search and what matters to me...

---

## SECTION 1: MY IMMEDIATE CONCERNS (What Keeps Me Awake at Night)

### 1. Memorials for My Loved Ones
This is my biggest concern. I want to honor my parents, spouse, or other family members who have passed. When I think about this, I search like this:

**What I actually search:**
- "gravestone engraving near me goa" (I don't know fancy words like "tombstone")
- "memorial stone for my mother goa" (Personal, emotional)
- "good stone carver mapusa" (I trust people, not brands)
- "reliable granite engraving in goa" (Reliability matters more than price)
- "stone memorial affordable goa" (But not cheap—quality that lasts)
- "stone carving artist goa" (I respect craftsmen)
- "engraving stone with name and dates" (Specific need)
- "lasting memorial stone goa" (Permanence is important)
- "respectful funeral stone engraving goa" (Dignity matters)
- "cemetery headstone engraving mapusa" (Direct, simple)

**Why I search this way:**
- I'm not looking for "laser engraving services"—I'm looking for someone I can trust
- I want local, nearby (I might not drive far or use apps)
- I use simple, emotional words ("my mother," "memorial")
- I care about permanence and quality more than trends
- I might call it "gravestone" or "memorial stone" interchangeably

### 2. Heritage & Tradition
I grew up with stories of our ancestors. Memorial stones aren't just products to me—they're sacred.

**What I search:**
- "traditional stone carving goa" (Respecting old ways)
- "stone carver with experience goa" (Proven track record)
- "authentic memorial stones goa" (Not cheap imitations)
- "stone engraving like the old days" (Wanting traditional quality)
- "artisan stone carver goa" (I value craft)
- "master stone engraver in mapusa" (Looking for someone with real skill)
- "generations of stone carving goa" (Family heritage appeals to me)

---

## SECTION 2: MY FAMILY NEEDS (What My Children Ask Me)

My children live in cities. They call me and say: "Papa/Mummy, we need a nice nameplate for our house" or "We want a memorial stone that's beautiful." They trust me to find a local artisan who can do it right.

### For Grandchildren's Homes (Name Plates)
**Elderly person's search language:**
- "house name plate stone goa" (Simple, clear)
- "nameplate for home mapusa" (Not "residential signage")
- "durable name plate granite" (Simple granite, not high-tech)
- "good quality nameplate goa" (Can last 20+ years)
- "affordable nameplate stone" (But worth the money)
- "black granite nameplate goa" (I've seen these—they look nice)
- "stone nameplate with house number" (Practical)
- "nameplate near mapusa" (Local is important)

### For Weddings & Anniversaries
**Elderly person's thinking:**
- "gift idea stone engraving goa" (Don't know about "personalized gifts")
- "stone engraving for anniversary" (Simple, meaningful)
- "wedding gift stone carving goa" (Something that lasts)
- "commemorative stone for family" (It's about memory)
- "engraved stone with names and date" (Specific, sentimental)
- "stone gift for special occasion goa" (Not commercial language)

---

## SECTION 3: MY CONCERNS ABOUT COST & RELIABILITY

### The Money Question
I'm retired. I have fixed income. I need good value.

**How I search for pricing:**
- "stone engraving price goa" (Direct question)
- "how much does gravestone cost goa" (Direct)
- "memorial stone price mapusa" (Practical)
- "affordable memorial stone goa" (Not "cheap"—I want quality)
- "reasonable stone engraving cost" (Fair price)
- "stone engraving rates goa" (What do people typically pay?)
- "stone carving charge goa" (How much should I budget?)
- "engraving without wasting money" (Don't want overcharged)

### The Trust Question
I need someone reliable. I can't come back and fix it myself.

**How I search for reliability:**
- "trusted stone carver goa" (Reputation matters)
- "stone engraver with good reviews goa" (What do others say?)
- "reliable memorial stone maker" (I need them to be dependable)
- "experienced stone carver mapusa" (Years of practice)
- "stone engraving business in goa since many years" (Established)
- "stone carver my friends recommend" (Word of mouth)

- "warranty stone engraving goa" (Will it last? What if something cracks?)

---

## SECTION 4: MY RELIGIOUS & CULTURAL VALUES

I might be Hindu, Christian, Muslim, or any faith. This matters to my search.

---

## SECTION 5: HOW I ACTUALLY SEARCH (My Real Behavior)

I don't use SEO keywords the way young people do. Here's how I actually search:

### Method 1: JustDial (Most Likely)
I open JustDial on my smartphone (my child taught me):
- Search: "stone engraving mapusa" OR "gravestone makers near me"
- I look at ratings (4.8 stars? 5 stars?)
- I read reviews (Do people say "good work"? "Reliable"?)

- "stone carver near mapusa" (Simple, local)
- "where to get grave stone in goa"

### Method 3: Ask People (Most Trusted)
